# Interactive Applications for High-Throughput STEM Data

Interactive applications based on voila and jupyterlab to explore and analyze EMD datasets collected 
during automated high-throughput STEM experiments.

# Installation

Clone the repository and install voila using
``pip install voila``

# Using the Applications to Analyze Data

Open the ``HTP_explorer.ipynb`` or ``HTP_analyzer.ipynb`` in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and input the file path.
